1. Let $R$ be a ring. Suppose $f_0 \in R, f_1 \in R[x_1], f_2 \in R[x_1, x_2], \ldots, f_n \in R[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ be arbitrary polynomials of $0,1, \ldots n$ variables. Then the quotient $R[x_1, \ldots, x_{n+1}] /(x_1-f_0, x_2-f_1(x_1), \ldots, x_{n+1}-f_n(x_1, \ldots, x_n))$ is isomorphic to $R$.

Proof

The evaluation homomorphism $\phi: P \to R$ is defined by sending each indeterminate $x_i$ (for $i = 1, \dots, n+1$) to the corresponding element $s_{i-1} \in R$, where $s_0 = f_0$ and $s_k = f_k(s_0, s_1, \dots, s_{k-1})$ for $k = 1, \dots, n$.

Explicitly, for any polynomial $p \in P$, $\phi(p)$ is the element in $R$ obtained by substituting $x_i \mapsto s_i$ for each $i$ and evaluating the resulting expression in $R$.

Since $R$ is commutative, this substitution preserves addition and multiplication, ensuring $\phi$ is a ring homomorphism.

- Surjectivity of $\phi$

The evaluation homomorphism $\phi: P \to R$, defined by substituting each indeterminate $x_i$ with the corresponding element $s_i \in R$ (recursively determined from the given sequence of polynomials $f_0, f_1, \dots, f_n$), is a ring homomorphism that extends the identity map on R. That is, $\phi$ fixes R pointwise: for any constant polynomial $r \in R \subset P$, $\phi(r) = r$.[4][5]
Since the constant polynomials form a copy of R inside $P$ and $\phi$ maps them to themselves, the image of $\phi$ contains all of R. As R is the codomain of $\phi$, the image must therefore equal R, implying that $\phi$ is surjective.[4]
More precisely, the subring of constant polynomials in $P$ is isomorphic to R via the inclusion map, and $\phi$ restricts to the identity on this subring. The image $\phi(P)$ is itself a subring of R (as $\phi$ is a ring homomorphism), and thus $\phi(P) \supseteq R$ together with $\phi(P) \subseteq R$ forces $\phi(P) = R$. This holds regardless of the specific recursive choice of the $s_i$, as long as they lie in R.[5][6]

- $\ker(ϕ) ⊇ I$

To prove that $\ker(\phi) \supseteq I$, it suffices to show that $\phi$ vanishes on each generator of the ideal $I$.
The ideal $I$ is generated by the elements $x_i - f_{i-1}(x_1, \dots, x_{i-1})$ for $i = 1, \dots, n+1$, where the sequence $f_0, f_1, \dots, f_n$ defines the recursive relations with chained dependencies.
By the definition of the evaluation homomorphism $\phi: P \to R$, which maps each indeterminate $x_j \mapsto s_j$ for $j = 1, \dots, n+1$, and where the elements $s_i \in R$ are defined recursively via $s_i = f_{i-1}(s_1, \dots, s_{i-1})$ (with appropriate base case for the recursion), we compute
$\phi(x_i - f_{i-1}(x_1, \dots, x_{i-1})) = \phi(x_i) - \phi(f_{i-1}(x_1, \dots, x_{i-1})) = s_i - f_{i-1}(s_1, \dots, s_{i-1}).$
By the recursive definition of the sequence $(s_i)$, the term $f_{i-1}(s_1, \dots, s_{i-1})$ equals $s_i$, so
$s_i - f_{i-1}(s_1, \dots, s_{i-1}) = s_i - s_i = 0.$
Thus, $\phi$ maps every generator of $I$ to zero. Since $\phi$ is a ring homomorphism, it maps the entire ideal generated by these elements to zero, meaning $I \subseteq \ker(\phi)$. This establishes the inclusion $\ker(\phi) \supseteq I$.

- $\ker(ϕ) ⊆ I$

To prove that $\ker(\phi) \subseteq I$, proceed by induction on the number of recursive relations (or equivalently, on the index $n$, where the polynomial ring has $n+1$ indeterminates).
For the base case with no recursive relations beyond a single variable ($n = 0$), consider $P = R[x_1]$ and $I = (x_1 - f_0)$ with $f_0 \in R$ constant and $\phi(x_1) = f_0 = s_1$. Any polynomial $g \in P$ can be written uniquely as $g = q(x_1)(x_1 - f_0) + r$ where $r \in R$ is the remainder (constant term after division by the monic linear polynomial $x_1 - f_0$). Applying $\phi$ gives $\phi(g) = \phi(r) = r$, since $\phi(x_1 - f_0) = 0$. If $g \in \ker(\phi)$, then $r = 0$, so $g = q(x_1)(x_1 - f_0) \in I$. Thus $\ker(\phi) \subseteq I$.[7]
Now assume the result holds for fewer than $n+1$ indeterminates (induction hypothesis). For the general case, let $Q = R[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ so that $P = Q[x_{n+1}]$, and let $I'$ be the ideal in $Q$ generated by the first $n$ relations: $I' = (x_1 - f_0, x_2 - f_1(x_1), \dots, x_n - f_{n-1}(x_1, \dots, x_{n-1}))$. Then $I = I' \cdot P + (x_{n+1} - f_n(x_1, \dots, x_n))$, where $f_n \in Q$.
Take any $g \in \ker(\phi)$, so $\phi(g) = g(s_1, \dots, s_{n+1}) = 0$. Since $x_{n+1} - f_n$ is monic in $x_{n+1}$, the division algorithm in $Q[x_{n+1}]$ yields unique $q \in P$ and $r \in Q$ such that
$g = q \cdot (x_{n+1} - f_n) + r.$
Applying $\phi$ gives
$\phi(g) = \phi(q) \cdot \phi(x_{n+1} - f_n) + \phi(r) = 0 + \phi(r) = r(s_1, \dots, s_n) = 0,$
since $\phi(x_{n+1} - f_n) = s_{n+1} - f_n(s_1, \dots, s_n) = 0$ by the recursive definition of the $s_i$. Thus $r$ lies in the kernel of the evaluation homomorphism from $Q$ to $R$ sending $x_i \mapsto s_i$ for $i = 1, \dots, n$. By the induction hypothesis applied to this lower-dimensional case, $r \in I'$.
It follows that
$g = q \cdot (x_{n+1} - f_n) + r \in (x_{n+1} - f_n) \cdot P + I' \cdot P \subseteq I.$
Hence $g \in I$, completing the induction. This shows that every element of $\ker(\phi)$ can be reduced to zero using successive division by the relations in $I$, starting from the highest variable and working downward.[7]

- Conclusion via First Isomorphism Theorem
Having established that the kernel of the evaluation homomorphism $\phi$ equals the ideal I, and that $\phi$ is surjective onto R, the first isomorphism theorem for rings applies directly. This theorem states that for any ring homomorphism $\phi : P \to R$, the quotient $P / \ker(\phi)$ is isomorphic to the image $\operatorname{im}(\phi)$.[8][9]
Since $\operatorname{im}(\phi)$ = R and $\ker(\phi)$ = I, it follows that $P / I$ $\cong R$. The induced isomorphism identifies cosets in $P / I$ with elements of R according to the action of $\phi$, yielding the desired ring isomorphism between the quotient of the polynomial ring by the recursively defined ideal and the base ring R itself. This completes the proof of the theorem.
