1. Let $R$ be a commutative ring. Suppose $f_0 \in R, f_1 \in R[x_1], f_2 \in R[x_1, x_2], \ldots, f_n \in R[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ be arbitrary polynomials of $0,1, \ldots n$ variables. Then the quotient $R[x_1, \ldots, x_{n+1}] /(x_1-f_0, x_2-f_1(x_1), \ldots, x_{n+1}-f_n(x_1, \ldots, x_n))$ is isomorphic to $R$.
    
    Proof
    
    The evaluation homomorphism $\phi: P \to R$ is defined by sending each indeterminate $x_i$ (for $i = 1, \dots, n+1$) to the corresponding element $s_{i-1} \in R$, where $s_0 = f_0$ and $s_k = f_k(s_0, s_1, \dots, s_{k-1})$ for $k = 1, \dots, n$.
    
    Explicitly, for any polynomial $p \in P$, $\phi(p)$ is the element in $R$ obtained by substituting $x_i \mapsto s_{i-1}$ for each $i$ and evaluating the resulting expression in $R$.
    
    Since $R$ is commutative, this substitution preserves addition and multiplication, ensuring $\phi$ is a ring homomorphism.
    
    - Surjectivity of $\phi$
    
        Since $\phi$ fixes any constant polynomial $r \in R \subset P$, the image of $\phi$ contains all of $R$. As the codomain of $\phi$ is also $R$, the image must be exactly $R$, which means $\phi$ is surjective.
    
    - $\ker(ϕ) ⊇ I$
    
        By the definition of the evaluation homomorphism $\phi: P \to R$, $\phi(x_i - f_{i-1}(x_1, \dots, x_{i-1})) = s_{i-1} - f_{i-1}(s_0, \dots, s_{i-2}) = s_{i-1} - s_{i-1} = 0$, where the last equality holds by the recursive definition of $(s_k)$.
    
        Thus, since $\phi$ is a ring homomorphism that maps every generator of $I$ to zero, it maps the entire ideal to zero, meaning $I \subseteq \ker(\phi)$.
    
    - $\ker(ϕ) ⊆ I$
    
        To prove that $\ker(\phi) \subseteq I$, proceed by induction on the number of recursive relations (or equivalently, on the index $n$, where the polynomial ring has $n+1$ indeterminates).
        
        For the base case with no recursive relations beyond a single variable ($n = 0$), consider $P = R[x_1]$ and $I = (x_1 - f_0)$ with $f_0 \in R$ constant and $\phi(x_1) = f_0 = s_0$. Any polynomial $g \in P$ can be written uniquely as $g = q(x_1)(x_1 - f_0) + r$ where $r \in R$ is the remainder (constant term after division by the monic linear polynomial $x_1 - f_0$). Applying $\phi$ gives $\phi(g) = \phi(r) = r$, since $\phi(x_1 - f_0) = 0$. If $g \in \ker(\phi)$, then $r = 0$, so $g = q(x_1)(x_1 - f_0) \in I$. Thus $\ker(\phi) \subseteq I$.
        
        Now assume the result holds for fewer than $n+1$ indeterminates (induction hypothesis). For the general case, let $Q = R[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ so that $P = Q[x_{n+1}]$, and let $I'$ be the ideal in $Q$ generated by the first $n$ relations: $I' = (x_1 - f_0, x_2 - f_1(x_1), \dots, x_n - f_{n-1}(x_1, \dots, x_{n-1}))$. Then $I = I' \cdot P + (x_{n+1} - f_n(x_1, \dots, x_n))$, where $f_n \in Q$.
        
        Take any $g \in \ker(\phi)$, so $\phi(g) = g(s_0, \dots, s_n) = 0$. Since $x_{n+1} - f_n$ is monic in $x_{n+1}$, the division algorithm in $Q[x_{n+1}]$ yields unique $q \in P$ and $r \in Q$ such that
        
        $g = q \cdot (x_{n+1} - f_n) + r.$
        
        Applying $\phi$ gives
        
        $\phi(g) = \phi(q) \cdot \phi(x_{n+1} - f_n) + \phi(r) = 0 + \phi(r) = r(s_0, \dots, s_{n-1}) = 0,$
        
        since $\phi(x_{n+1} - f_n) = s_n - f_n(s_0, \dots, s_{n-1}) = 0$ by the recursive definition of the $s_i$. Thus $r$ lies in the kernel of the evaluation homomorphism from $Q$ to $R$ sending $x_i \mapsto s_{i-1}$ for $i = 1, \dots, n$. By the induction hypothesis, $r \in I'$.
        
        It follows that
        
        $g = q \cdot (x_{n+1} - f_n) + r \in (x_{n+1} - f_n) \cdot P + I' \cdot P \subseteq I.$
        
        Hence $g \in I$, completing the induction.
        
    - Conclusion
    
        By the First Isomorphism Theorem for rings, since $\mathrm{im}(\phi) = R$ and $\ker(\phi) = I$, it follows that $P / I \cong R$. This completes the proof.
2. Let $\varphi: R \rightarrow R'$ be a map of rings, $\mathfrak{a}$ an ideal of $R$, and $\mathfrak{b}$ an ideal of $R'$. Prove the following statements:
    1. Then $\mathfrak{a}^{e c} \supset \mathfrak{a}$ and $\mathfrak{b}^{c e} \subset \mathfrak{b}$.
    2. Then $\mathfrak{a}^{\text {ece }}=\mathfrak{a}^e$ and $\mathfrak{b}^{\text {cec }}=\mathfrak{b}^c$.
    3. If $\mathfrak{b}$ is an extension, then $\mathfrak{b}^c$ is the largest ideal of $R$ with extension $\mathfrak{b}$.
    4. If two extensions have the same contraction, then they are equal.
