1. Show that the functor $\mathrm{Ext}(-,-)$ is contravariant in the first variable, that is, if $H, H'$ and $G$ are abelian groups, a homomorphism $\alpha: H \rightarrow H'$ induces a homomorphism $\alpha^*: \mathrm{Ext}\left(H', G\right) \rightarrow \mathrm{Ext}(H, G)$.

2. Regarding $`\mathbb{Z}_2`$ as a module over the ring $`\mathbb{Z}_4`$, construct a resolution of $`\mathbb{Z}_2`$ by free modules over $`\mathbb{Z}_4`$, and use this to show that $\mathrm{Ext}_{\mathbb{Z}_4}^n(\mathbb{Z}_2, \mathbb{Z}_2)$ is nonzero for all $n$.
   
   **Proof**

   Using the projective resolution
   
   $\dots\xrightarrow{\times2}\mathbb{Z}_4\xrightarrow{\times2}\mathbb{Z}_4\xrightarrow{\bmod 2}\mathbb{Z}_2\to 0$

   Verify exactness at each position. At $\mathbb{Z}_2$, the map $\pi$ is surjective by construction, so exactness holds there.
   
   For $n \geq 1$, consider exactness at the term $\mathbb{Z}_4$ in position $n$. The outgoing differential is $d_n \colon \mathbb{Z}_4 \to \mathbb{Z}_4$, multiplication by 2.
   
Its kernel is $\ker(d_n) = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z}_4 \mid 2x = 0 \} = 2\mathbb{Z}_4 = \{0, 2\} \cong \mathbb{Z}_2.$
   
   The incoming differential is also multiplication by 2, so its image is
   
   $\operatorname{im}(d_{n+1}) = 2\mathbb{Z}_4 \cong \mathbb{Z}_2.$
   
   Thus, $\ker(d_n) = \operatorname{im}(d_{n+1})$ for all $n \geq 1$, establishing exactness at every positive degree.
   
   After applying $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{Z}_4}(-, \mathbb{Z}_2)$ to the projective part of the resolution, the differentials in the resulting cochain complex are all zero

   Computing homology
   
   $\mathrm{Ext}_{\mathbb{Z}_4}^n(\mathbb{Z}_2, \mathbb{Z}_2) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2$ for all $n \ge 0$, which is nonzero.
   
3. Compute the cohomology of the spaces $S^1 \times S^1, \mathbb{R} \mathbb{P}^2$ and the Klein bottle first with $\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients, then with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients.

4. Show that if $f: S^n \rightarrow S^n$ has degree $d$, then $f^*: H^n(S^n ; G) \rightarrow H^n(S^n ; G)$ is multiplication by $d$.

5. Show that if $A$ is a closed subspace of $X$ that is a deformation retract of some neighborhood, then the quotient map $X \rightarrow X / A$ induces isomorphisms
    
    $H^n(X, A ; G) \cong \tilde{H}^n(X / A ; G)$
    
    for all $n$.

6. Let $X$ be a space obtained from $S^n$ by attaching a cell $e^{n+1}$ by a degree $m$ map.
    - Show that the quotient map $X \rightarrow X / S^n=S^{n+1}$ induces the trivial map on $\tilde{H}_i(-; \mathbb{Z})$ for all $i$, but not on $H^{n+1}(-; \mathbb{Z})$. Conclude that the splitting in the universal coefficient theorem for cohomology cannot be natural.
    - Show that the inclusion $S^n \hookrightarrow X$ induces the trivial map on $\tilde{H}^i(-; \mathbb{Z})$ for all $i$, but not on $H_n(-; \mathbb{Z})$.

7. For a topological space $X$, let
        
    $\langle,\rangle: C^n(X) \otimes C_n(X) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$
    
    be the Kronecker pairing given by $\langle\phi, \sigma\rangle:=\phi(\sigma)$. In terms of this pairing, the coboundary map $\delta: C^n(X) \rightarrow C^{n+1}(X)$ is defined by $\langle\delta(\phi), \sigma\rangle=\langle\phi, \partial \sigma\rangle$ for all $\sigma \in C_{n+1}(X)$. Show that this pairing induces a pairing between cohomology and homology:
    
    $\langle,\rangle: H^n(X ; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes H_n(X ; \mathbb{Z}) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z} .$

    **Proof**

    Define $\langle [\phi], [\sigma] \rangle = \phi(\sigma)$
    
    Well-defined: This definition is independent of the choice of representatives.

   If $[\phi]=0$, then $\phi = \delta\psi$. For any cycle $\sigma$, $\langle [\phi], [\sigma] \rangle = \phi(\sigma) = (\delta\psi)(\sigma) = \psi(\partial\sigma) = \psi(0) = 0.

   If $[\sigma]=0$, then $\sigma = \partial\tau$. For any cocycle $\phi$, $\langle [\phi], [\sigma] \rangle = \phi(\sigma) = \phi(\partial\tau) = (\delta\phi)(\tau) = 0(\tau) = 0.
   
    Non-degeneracy:
    Take a basis for $C_n(X)$ and consider the dual basis in $C^n(X)$.
