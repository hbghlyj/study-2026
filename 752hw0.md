1. Describe a cell structure on $X=\mathbb{RP}^2 \vee S^3$ and calculate $H_*(X)$.

   A cell structure on $X=\mathbb{RP}^2 \vee S^3$
   - one 0-cell (the wedge point),
   - one 1-cell (from $\mathbb{RP}^2$),
   - one 2-cell (from $\mathbb{RP}^2$),
   - one 3-cell (from $S^3$).

    The cellular chain complex is:
    $$0 \rightarrow C_3 \xrightarrow{d_3} C_2 \xrightarrow{d_2} C_1 \xrightarrow{d_1} C_0 \rightarrow 0,$$
    where
    - $C_0 \cong \mathbb{Z}$ (generated by the 0-cell),
    - $C_1 \cong \mathbb{Z}$ (generated by the 1-cell),
    - $C_2 \cong \mathbb{Z}$ (generated by the 2-cell),
    - $C_3 \cong \mathbb{Z}$ (generated by the 3-cell).

    The boundary maps are:
    - $d_1: C_1 \rightarrow C_0$ is zero (since the 1-cell is attached to the 0-cell),
    - $d_2: C_2 \rightarrow C_1$ is multiplication by 2 (since the 2-cell in $\mathbb{RP}^2$ wraps around the 1-cell twice),
    - $d_3: C_3 \rightarrow C_2$ is zero (since the 3-cell is attached to the wedge point).

    Now we compute the homology groups:
    - $H_0(X) = \ker(d_0)/\text{im}(d_1) \cong \mathbb{Z}$,
    - $H_1(X) = \ker(d_1)/\text{im}(d_2) \cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$,
    - $H_2(X) = \ker(d_2)/\text{im}(d_3) \cong 0$,
    - $H_3(X) = \ker(d_3)/\text{im}(0) \cong \mathbb{Z}$.

2. Let $f: S^n \rightarrow S^n$ be a map of degree $m$. Let $X=S^n \cup_f D^{n+1}$ be a space obtained from $S^n$ by attaching a ($n+1$)-cell via $f$. Compute the homology of $X$.

    The space $X$ is formed by attaching a $(n+1)$-cell to $S^n$ via the map $f$. The cellular chain complex for $X$ is:
    $$0 \rightarrow C_{n+1} \xrightarrow{d_{n+1}} C_n \xrightarrow{d_n} C_{n-1} \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow C_0 \rightarrow 0,$$
    where
    - $C_0 \cong \mathbb{Z}$ (generated by the 0-cell),
    - $C_n \cong \mathbb{Z}$ (generated by the $n$-cell from $S^n$),
    - $C_{n+1} \cong \mathbb{Z}$ (generated by the $(n+1)$-cell).
    
    The boundary maps are:
    - $d_n: C_n \rightarrow C_{n-1}$ is zero (since there are no $(n-1)$-cells),
    - $d_{n+1}: C_{n+1} \rightarrow C_n$ is multiplication by $m$ (the degree of the map $f$).
    
    Now we compute the homology groups:
    - For $k < n$, $H_k(X) = 0$ since there are no cells in those dimensions.
    - For $k = n$, 
      $$H_n(X) = \ker(d_n)/\text{im}(d_{n+1}) = C_n/\text{im}(d_{n+1}) = \mathbb{Z}/(m\mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}_m.$$
    - For $k = n+1$, 
      $$H_{n+1}(X) = \ker(d_{n+1}) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } m \neq 0 \\ \mathbb{Z} & \text{if } m = 0 \end{cases}$$
    
3. Compute the homology of the Klein bottle, $K$, with $\mathbb{Z}_3$-coefficients.

4. Let $0 \leq m<n$. Compute the homology of $\mathbb{R P}^n / \mathbb{R P}^m$.

5. Let $f: S^{2 n} \rightarrow S^{2 n}$ be a continuous map. Show that there is a point $x \in S^{2 n}$ so that either $f(x)=x$ or $f(x)=-x$.

6. Is there a continuous map $f: \mathbb{RP}^{2 k-1} \rightarrow \mathbb{RP}^{2 k-1}$ with no fixed points? Explain.

7. Let $X$ be the space obtained by attaching two 2-cells to $S^1$, one via the map $z \mapsto z^3$ and the other via $z \mapsto z^5$, where $z$ denotes the complex coordinate on $S^1 \subset \mathbb{C}$.

    (a) Compute the homology of $X$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}$.
    
    (b) Is $X$ homeomorphic to the 2-sphere $S^2$? Justify your answer!
