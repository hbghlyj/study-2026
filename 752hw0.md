1. Describe a cell structure on $X=\mathbb{RP}^2 \vee S^3$ and calculate $H_*(X)$.

   A cell structure on $X=\mathbb{RP}^2 \vee S^3$
   - one 0-cell (the wedge point),
   - one 1-cell (from $\mathbb{RP}^2$),
   - one 2-cell (from $\mathbb{RP}^2$),
   - one 3-cell (from $S^3$).

    The cellular chain complex is:
    $$0 \rightarrow C_3 \xrightarrow{d_3} C_2 \xrightarrow{d_2} C_1 \xrightarrow{d_1} C_0 \rightarrow 0,$$
    where
    - $C_0 \cong \mathbb{Z}$ (generated by the 0-cell),
    - $C_1 \cong \mathbb{Z}$ (generated by the 1-cell),
    - $C_2 \cong \mathbb{Z}$ (generated by the 2-cell),
    - $C_3 \cong \mathbb{Z}$ (generated by the 3-cell).

    The boundary maps are:
    - $d_1: C_1 \rightarrow C_0$ is zero (since the 1-cell is attached to the 0-cell),
    - $d_2: C_2 \rightarrow C_1$ is multiplication by 2 (since the antipodal map $S^1\to S^1$ has degree $(-1)^2=1$),
    - $d_3: C_3 \rightarrow C_2$ is zero (since the 3-cell is attached to the wedge point).

    Now we compute the homology groups:
    - $H_0(X) = \ker(d_0)/\text{im}(d_1) \cong \mathbb{Z}$,
    - $H_1(X) = \ker(d_1)/\text{im}(d_2) \cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$,
    - $H_2(X) = \ker(d_2)/\text{im}(d_3) \cong 0$,
    - $H_3(X) = \ker(d_3)/\text{im}(0) \cong \mathbb{Z}$.

2. Let $f: S^n \rightarrow S^n$ be a map of degree $m$. Let $X=S^n \cup_f D^{n+1}$ be a space obtained from $S^n$ by attaching a ($n+1$)-cell via $f$. Compute the homology of $X$.

    For $n \ge 1$, we can use the standard CW structure on $S^n$ with one 0-cell and one $n$-cell. Then $X = S^n \cup_f D^{n+1}$ has a CW structure with one 0-cell, one $n$-cell, and one $(n+1)$-cell. This leads to the following chain groups:
    - $C_0 \cong \mathbb{Z}$ (generated by the 0-cell),
    - $C_n \cong \mathbb{Z}$ (generated by the $n$-cell from $S^n$),
    - $C_{n+1} \cong \mathbb{Z}$ (generated by the $(n+1)$-cell).
    
    The boundary maps are:
    - $d_n: C_n \rightarrow C_{n-1}$ is zero (since there are no $(n-1)$-cells),
    - $d_{n+1}: C_{n+1} \rightarrow C_n$ is multiplication by $m$ (the degree of the map $f$).
    
    Now we compute the homology groups:
    - For $k = 0$, $H_0(X) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ (since $X$ is path-connected).
    - For $0 < k < n$, $H_k(X) = 0$ since there are no cells in those dimensions.
    - For $k = n$, 
$$H_n(X) = \ker(d_n)/\text{im}(d_{n+1}) = C_n/\text{im}(d_{n+1}) = \begin{cases} \mathbb{Z}_{|m|} & \text{if } m \neq 0 \cr \mathbb{Z} & \text{if } m = 0 \end{cases}.$$
    - For $k = n+1$, 
      $$H_{n+1}(X) = \ker(d_{n+1}) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } m \neq 0 \cr \mathbb{Z} & \text{if } m = 0 \end{cases}$$
    
3. Compute the homology of the Klein bottle, $K$, with $\mathbb{Z}_3$-coefficients.

    The Klein bottle $K$ can be represented as a cell complex with:
    - one 0-cell,
    - two 1-cells (let's call them $a$ and $b$),
    - one 2-cell.
    
    The cellular chain complex is:
    $$0 \rightarrow C_2 \xrightarrow{d_2} C_1 \xrightarrow{d_1} C_0 \rightarrow 0,$$
    where
    - $C_0 \cong \mathbb{Z}_3$ (generated by the 0-cell),
    - $C_1 \cong \mathbb{Z}_3^2$ (generated by the 1-cells $a$ and $b$),
    - $C_2 \cong \mathbb{Z}_3$ (generated by the 2-cell).
    
    The boundary maps are:
    - $d_1: C_1 \rightarrow C_0$ is zero (since both 1-cells are attached to the same 0-cell),
    - $d_2: C_2 \rightarrow C_1$ is given by $d_2(1) = a+b+a-b = 2a$, which corresponds to attaching the 2-cell along the boundary word $abab^{-1}$.

    Now we compute the homology groups:
    - $H_0(K; \mathbb{Z}_3) = \ker(d_0)/\text{im}(d_1) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3$,
    - $H_1(K; \mathbb{Z}_3) = \ker(d_1)/\text{im}(d_2) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3^2 / \langle 2a \rangle \cong \mathbb{Z}_3$, since $\langle 2a \rangle = \langle a \rangle$ over $\mathbb{Z}_3$.
    - $H_2(K; \mathbb{Z}_3) = \ker(d_2)/\text{im}(d_3) = \ker(d_2)/0 \cong 0$, since $d_2$ is injective over the field $\mathbb{Z}_3$.

4. Let $0 \leq m<n$. Compute the homology of $\mathbb{R P}^n / \mathbb{R P}^m$.

    The space $\mathbb{RP}^n / \mathbb{RP}^m$ has a cell structure with:
    - one 0-cell (the point corresponding to $\mathbb{RP}^m$),
    - one $k$-cell for each $k$ from $m+1$ to $n$.
    
    The non-zero cellular chain groups are $C_0 \cong \mathbb{Z}$ and $C_k \cong \mathbb{Z}$ for $m+1 \le k \le n$. The boundary maps $d_k: C_k \to C_{k-1}$ for $k > m+1$ are given by multiplication by $1+(-1)^k$ because the antipodal map $S^{k-1}\to S^{k-1}$ has degree $(-1)^k$. The map $d_{m+1}$ is zero since $C_m=0$.

    The chain complex for $k>0$ is:
    $$
    0 \to C_n \xrightarrow{d_n} C_{n-1} \to \dots \to C_{m+2} \xrightarrow{d_{m+2}} C_{m+1} \to 0
    $$
    
    The homology groups are computed as $H_k(X) = \ker(d_k)/\text{im}(d_{k+1})$:
    - $H_0(X) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ (path-connected).
    - $H_k(X) = 0$ for $1 \le k \le m$ and $k > n$.
    - $H_{m+1}(X) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2$ if $m$ is even, and $\mathbb{Z}$ if $m$ is odd.
    - For $m+1 < k < n$, $H_k(X) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2$ if $k$ is odd, and $0$ if $k$ is even.
    - $H_n(X) \cong 0$ if $n$ is even, and $\mathbb{Z}$ if $n$ is odd.

5. Let $f: S^{2 n} \rightarrow S^{2 n}$ be a continuous map. Show that there is a point $x \in S^{2 n}$ so that either $f(x)=x$ or $f(x)=-x$.

    If there is no point $x$ such that $f(x) = x$, then we can define a straight-line homotopy from $f$ to the antipodal map $A(x) = -x$ by
    $$H(x,t) = \frac{(1-t)f(x) + t(-x)}{\|(1-t)f(x) + t(-x)\|}.$$
    To show the denominator is never zero, assume for contradiction that $(1-t)f(x) + t(-x) = 0$ for some $t \in [0,1]$. This implies $(1-t)f(x) = tx$. Since $x, f(x) \in S^{2n}$, they are unit vectors. Taking norms gives $1-t=t$, so $t=1/2$. This would mean $f(x)=x$, contradicting our assumption. Thus, the homotopy is well-defined and shows that $f$ is homotopic to the antipodal map. The degree of the antipodal map on $S^{2n}$ is $(-1)^{2n+1} = -1$. Since degree is a homotopy invariant, we have $\deg(f) = \deg(A) = -1.
    
    If there is no point $x$ such that $f(x) = -x$, we can similarly define a homotopy from $f$ to the identity map. The degree of the identity map is $1$. Thus, if neither $f(x) = x$ nor $f(x) = -x$ has a solution, we reach a contradiction since $\deg(f)$ cannot be both $1$ and $-1$. Therefore, there must exist a point $x \in S^{2n}$ such that either $f(x) = x$ or $f(x) = -x$.

6. Is there a continuous map $f: \mathbb{RP}^{2 k-1} \rightarrow \mathbb{RP}^{2 k-1}$ with no fixed points? Explain.

7. Let $X$ be the space obtained by attaching two 2-cells to $S^1$, one via the map $z \mapsto z^3$ and the other via $z \mapsto z^5$, where $z$ denotes the complex coordinate on $S^1 \subset \mathbb{C}$.

    (a) Compute the homology of $X$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}$.
    
    (b) Is $X$ homeomorphic to the 2-sphere $S^2$? Justify your answer!
