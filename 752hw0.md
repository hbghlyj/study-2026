1. Describe a cell structure on $X=\mathbb{RP}^2 \vee S^3$ and calculate $H_*(X)$.

   A cell structure on $X=\mathbb{RP}^2 \vee S^3$
   - one 0-cell (the wedge point),
   - one 1-cell (from $\mathbb{RP}^2$),
   - one 2-cell (from $\mathbb{RP}^2$),
   - one 3-cell (from $S^3$).

    The cellular chain complex is:
    $$0 \rightarrow C_3 \xrightarrow{d_3} C_2 \xrightarrow{d_2} C_1 \xrightarrow{d_1} C_0 \rightarrow 0,$$
    where
    - $C_0 \cong \mathbb{Z}$ (generated by the 0-cell),
    - $C_1 \cong \mathbb{Z}$ (generated by the 1-cell),
    - $C_2 \cong \mathbb{Z}$ (generated by the 2-cell),
    - $C_3 \cong \mathbb{Z}$ (generated by the 3-cell).

    The boundary maps are:
    - $d_1: C_1 \rightarrow C_0$ is zero (since the 1-cell is attached to the 0-cell),
    - $d_2: C_2 \rightarrow C_1$ is multiplication by 2 (since the 2-cell in $\mathbb{RP}^2$ wraps around the 1-cell twice),
    - $d_3: C_3 \rightarrow C_2$ is zero (since the 3-cell is attached to the wedge point).

    Now we compute the homology groups:
    - $H_0(X) = \ker(d_0)/\text{im}(d_1) \cong \mathbb{Z}$,
    - $H_1(X) = \ker(d_1)/\text{im}(d_2) \cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$,
    - $H_2(X) = \ker(d_2)/\text{im}(d_3) \cong 0$,
    - $H_3(X) = \ker(d_3)/\text{im}(0) \cong \mathbb{Z}$.

2. Let $f: S^n \rightarrow S^n$ be a map of degree $m$. Let $X=S^n \cup_f D^{n+1}$ be a space obtained from $S^n$ by attaching a ($n+1$)-cell via $f$. Compute the homology of $X$.

3. Compute the homology of the Klein bottle, $K$, with $\mathbb{Z}_3$-coefficients.

    The Klein bottle $K$ can be represented as a cell complex with:
    - one 0-cell,
    - two 1-cells (let's call them $a$ and $b$),
    - one 2-cell.
    
    The cellular chain complex is:
    $$0 \rightarrow C_2 \xrightarrow{d_2} C_1 \xrightarrow{d_1} C_0 \rightarrow 0,$$
    where
    - $C_0 \cong \mathbb{Z}_3$ (generated by the 0-cell),
    - $C_1 \cong \mathbb{Z}_3^2$ (generated by the 1-cells $a$ and $b$),
    - $C_2 \cong \mathbb{Z}_3$ (generated by the 2-cell).
    
    The boundary maps are:
    - $d_1: C_1 \rightarrow C_0$ is zero (since both 1-cells are attached to the same 0-cell),
    - $d_2: C_2 \rightarrow C_1$ is given by $d_2(1) = 2a$

    Now we compute the homology groups:
    - $H_0(K; \mathbb{Z}_3) = \ker(d_0)/\text{im}(d_1) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3$,
    - $H_1(K; \mathbb{Z}_3) = \ker(d_1)/\text{im}(d_2) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3^2 / \langle 2a \rangle \cong \mathbb{Z}_3$,
    - $H_2(K; \mathbb{Z}_3) = \ker(d_2)/\text{im}(0) \cong 0$.

4. Let $0 \leq m<n$. Compute the homology of $\mathbb{R P}^n / \mathbb{R P}^m$.

5. Let $f: S^{2 n} \rightarrow S^{2 n}$ be a continuous map. Show that there is a point $x \in S^{2 n}$ so that either $f(x)=x$ or $f(x)=-x$.

6. Is there a continuous map $f: \mathbb{RP}^{2 k-1} \rightarrow \mathbb{RP}^{2 k-1}$ with no fixed points? Explain.

7. Let $X$ be the space obtained by attaching two 2-cells to $S^1$, one via the map $z \mapsto z^3$ and the other via $z \mapsto z^5$, where $z$ denotes the complex coordinate on $S^1 \subset \mathbb{C}$.

    (a) Compute the homology of $X$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}$.
    
    (b) Is $X$ homeomorphic to the 2-sphere $S^2$? Justify your answer!
