1. Describe a cell structure on $X=\mathbb{RP}^2 \vee S^3$ and calculate $H_*(X)$.

2. Let $f: S^n \rightarrow S^n$ be a map of degree $m$. Let $X=S^n \cup_f D^{n+1}$ be a space obtained from $S^n$ by attaching a ($n+1$)-cell via $f$. Compute the homology of $X$.

3. Compute the homology of the Klein bottle, $K$, with $\mathbb{Z}_3$-coefficients.

4. Let $0 \leq m<n$. Compute the homology of $\mathbb{R P}^n / \mathbb{R P}^m$.

5. Let $f: S^{2 n} \rightarrow S^{2 n}$ be a continuous map. Show that there is a point $x \in S^{2 n}$ so that either $f(x)=x$ or $f(x)=-x$.

6. Is there a continuous map $f: \mathbb{RP}^{2 k-1} \rightarrow \mathbb{RP}^{2 k-1}$ with no fixed points? Explain.

7. Let $X$ be the space obtained by attaching two 2-cells to $S^1$, one via the map $z \mapsto z^3$ and the other via $z \mapsto z^5$, where $z$ denotes the complex coordinate on $S^1 \subset \mathbb{C}$.

    (a) Compute the homology of $X$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}$.
    
    (b) Is $X$ homeomorphic to the 2-sphere $S^2$? Justify your answer!
