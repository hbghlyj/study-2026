Problems based on Tuesday 1/20 lecture:
1. Two Riemannian metrics $g$ and $h$ on the same manifold $M$ are said to be conformal if there exists a positive smooth function $f(x)$ such that
  $g=f \cdot h .$
  Show that angles between tangent vectors are the same with respect to $g$ and $h$.
2. Show that the round metric on $S^n$ is given in stereographic coordinates by
  $$g_{i j}=\frac{4 \delta_{i j}}{\left(1+|x|^2\right)^2} .$$

Problems based on Thursday 1/22 lecture:

9. Show that $|g|_g \equiv \sqrt{n}$, where $n=\dim(M)$.
