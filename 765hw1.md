Problems based on Tuesday 1/20 lecture:
1. Two Riemannian metrics $g$ and $h$ on the same manifold $M$ are said to be conformal if there exists a positive smooth function $f(x)$ such that
  $g=f \cdot h .$

    Show that angles between tangent vectors are the same with respect to $g$ and $h$.

   **Proof**
    
    The cosine of the angle between two tangent vectors $X_1, X_2 \in T_p M$ with respect to $g$ is given by

   $\cos \theta_g = \frac{g(X_1, X_2)}{\sqrt{g(X_1, X_1) g(X_2, X_2)}}.$

    If $g = f h$ with $f > 0$, then

    $\cos \theta_g = \frac{f h(X_1, X_2)}{\sqrt{f h(X_1, X_1) \cdot f h(X_2, X_2)}} = \frac{f h(X_1, X_2)}{f \sqrt{h(X_1, X_1) h(X_2, X_2)}} = \frac{h(X_1, X_2)}{\sqrt{h(X_1, X_1) h(X_2, X_2)}} = \cos \theta_h.$

    Thus, $\theta_g=\theta_h$.

2. Show that the round metric on $S^n$ is given in stereographic coordinates by

   $$g_{i j}=\frac{4 \delta_{i j}}{\left(1+|x|^2\right)^2} .$$

   **Proof**

    The inverse stereographic projection from the North Pole, $\Phi: \mathbb{R}^{n} \to S^n \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, is given in stereographic coordinates $x^i$ by:

    $$u^i = \frac{2x^i}{1+|x|^2} \quad \text{for } i=1,\dots,n,$$

    $$u^{n+1} = \frac{|x|^2 - 1}{|x|^2 + 1} = 1 - \frac{2}{1+|x|^2},$$

    where $|x|^2 = \sum_{k=1}^n (x^k)^2$.

    The induced metric is found by pulling back the Euclidean metric from $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. By definition, the components of the metric tensor $g_{ij}$ are:

   $`g_{ij}=g(e^i,e^j)=g_{\text{Euc}}(\Phi_*(e^i),\Phi_*(e^j))=g_{\text{Euc}}(\frac{\partial\Phi}{\partial x^i},\frac{\partial\Phi}{\partial x^j})=\sum _{k=1}^{n+1}\frac{\partial u^{k}}{\partial x^{i}}\frac{\partial u^{k}}{\partial x^{j}}`$

   Computing the partial derivatives of the embedding $\Phi$, let $D = 1 + |x|^2$. Then:

    $$\frac{\partial u^k}{\partial x^i} = \frac{2 \delta_{ki} D - 4 x^k x^i}{D^2} \quad \text{for } k \leq n,$$

    $$\frac{\partial u^{n+1}}{\partial x^i} = \frac{4 x^i}{D^2}.$$

    The metric components are $g_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{n+1} \frac{\partial u^k}{\partial x^i} \frac{\partial u^k}{\partial x^j}$, which expands to:

    $$g_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \left( \frac{2 \delta_{ki} D - 4 x^k x^i}{D^2} \right) \left( \frac{2 \delta_{kj} D - 4 x^k x^j}{D^2} \right) + \frac{16 x^i x^j}{D^4}.$$

    Expanding the summation yields:

    $$g_{ij} = \frac{1}{D^4} \left( 4 \delta_{ij} D^2 - 16 x^i x^j D + 16 x^i x^j (|x|^2 + 1) \right).$$

    Since $D = 1 + |x|^2$, the cross terms cancel: $-16 x^i x^j D + 16 x^i x^j (|x|^2 + 1) = -16 x^i x^j D + 16 x^i x^j D = 0$, leaving:

    $$g_{ij} = \frac{4 \delta_{ij} D^2}{D^4} = \frac{4 \delta_{ij}}{(1 + |x|^2)^2}.$$
3. For a free and proper isometric action of a Lie group $G$ on a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$, the quotient manifold $N = M/G$ inherits a unique Riemannian metric $\bar{g}$, known as the quotient metric, defined such that the projection $π: (M, g) → (N, \bar{g})$ is a Riemannian submersion.

    **Proof**
  
    For $q ∈ N$ and tangent vectors $X, Y ∈ T_q N$, the metric is given by $\bar{g}_q(X, Y) = g_p(\tilde{X}, \tilde{Y})$, where $p ∈ π^{-1}(q)$ is any point in the fiber over $q$, and $\tilde{X}, \tilde{Y} ∈ T_p M$ are the unique horizontal lifts of $X$ and $Y$, respectively.
    
    The horizontal lift $\tilde{X}$ is the unique vector in the horizontal space $H_p$ satisfying $d\pi_p(\tilde{X}) = X$.
    
    $H_p$ is the orthogonal complement of the vertical space $V_p = T_p(\pi^{-1}(q)) = \ker(d\pi_p)$ in $T_p M$.
  
    The quotient metric $\bar{g}_q$ is well-defined because its value does not depend on which point $p$ in the fiber $\pi^{-1}(q)$ is chosen for the calculation, since the action of the Lie group $G$ is isometric, it maps horizontal spaces to horizontal spaces. If you move from one point $p$ in a fiber to another point in the same fiber via the group action, the differential of that action maps the horizontal lift at the first point to the horizontal lift at the second. Because the action preserves both the metric and the horizontal lifts, the inner product $g_p(\tilde{X}, \tilde{Y})$ remains constant as you move along the fiber.
4. For $0<a<b$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}$, consider a vertical line segment $I=\{(x, y) \mid a \leq y \leq b\} \subset \mathbb{H}^2$.
    
    1. Calculate the length $L(I)$ in the hyperbolic metric.
    
        Parameterize the vertical line segment $I$ by $\gamma(t) = (x, t)$ for $t \in [a, b]$. The hyperbolic metric on $\mathbb{H}^2$ is given by $g_{(x,y)} = \frac{dx^2 + dy^2}{y^2}$.
        
        $L(I) = \int_a^b \sqrt{g_{\gamma(t)}(\dot{\gamma}(t), \dot{\gamma}(t))} \ dt = \int_a^b \sqrt{\frac{0^2 + 1^2}{t^2}} \ dt = \int_a^b \frac{1}{t} \ dt = \ln(b) - \ln(a) = \ln\left(\frac{b}{a}\right).$
    
    2. Prove that $I$ is length-minimizing.
    
        **Proof**
        
        Let $\gamma: [0, 1] \to \mathbb{H}^2$ be any smooth curve connecting the points $(x, a)$ and $(x, b)$. The length of $\gamma$ in the hyperbolic metric is given by
        
        $L(\gamma) = \int_0^1 \sqrt{g_{\gamma(t)}(\dot{\gamma}(t), \dot{\gamma}(t))} \ dt = \int_0^1 \frac{\sqrt{\dot{x}(t)^2 + \dot{y}(t)^2}}{y(t)} \ dt.$
        
        Since $\sqrt{\dot{x}(t)^2 + \dot{y}(t)^2} \ge |\dot{y}(t)|$, the length is minimized when $\dot{x}(t) = 0$. For any curve, the length $L(\gamma) \ge \int_0^1 \frac{|\dot{y}(t)|}{y(t)} dt$. Assuming a monotonic path, this becomes $\int_a^b \frac{dy}{y} = \ln(b/a) = L(I)$. Any path where $\dot{x}(t)$ is not always zero will be strictly longer, which proves that $I$ is length-minimizing.

5. Prove that the Riemannian distance corresponding to the Euclidean metric $g_{i j}=\delta_{i j}$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ coincides with the Euclidean distance.

    **Proof**
    
Let $M = \mathbb{R}^n$ with the Euclidean metric $g_{ij} = \delta_{ij}$. The length of a curve $\gamma: [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}^n$ from $p$ to $q$ is $L(\gamma) = \int_0^1 \|\dot{\gamma}(t)\| dt$. The Riemannian distance $d_g(p,q)$ is the infimum of these lengths. By the triangle inequality for integrals, we have $\|q-p\| = \|\int_0^1 \dot{\gamma}(t) dt\| \le \int_0^1 \|\dot{\gamma}(t)\| dt = L(\gamma)$. This shows that any path is at least as long as the Euclidean distance $\|p-q\|$. The straight line path $\gamma_0(t) = p + t(q-p)$ has length $L(\gamma_0) = \int_0^1 \|q-p\| dt = \|p-q\|$. Since this path achieves the lower bound, the infimum is $\|p-q\|$, so $d_g(p, q) = \|p - q\|$.

6. Prove that the Riemannian distance $d_g: M \times M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a metric in the usual sense.
    
    **Proof**
    
    The Riemannian distance $d_g$ is defined as the infimum of the lengths of all smooth curves connecting two points in a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$. We need to verify the following properties:
    
    1. For any $p, q \in M$, $d_g(p, q) \geq 0$ and $d_g(p, q) = 0$ if and only if $p = q$. This follows from the positive definiteness of the metric $g$.
    
    2. For any $p, q \in M$, $d_g(p, q) = d_g(q, p)$ (symmetry). This is because the length of a curve is independent of the direction in which it is traversed.
    
    3. For any $p, q, r \in M$, $d_g(p, q) \leq d_g(p, r) + d_g(r, q)$ (triangle inequality). This follows from the fact the concatenation of curves connecting $p$ to $r$ and $r$ to $q$ provides a curve connecting $p$ to $q$, and thus the infimum of lengths must satisfy the triangle inequality.

7. Show that the inversion map

    $(x, y) \mapsto \frac{(x, y)}{x^2+y^2}$
    
    is an isometry of the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^2$.
    
    **Proof**
    
    Let $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$. Define $u = x / r^2$ and $v = y / r^2$. The partial derivatives are
    
    $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{r^2 - 2x^2}{r^4}, \quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = \frac{-2xy}{r^4}, \quad \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = \frac{-2xy}{r^4}, \quad \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = \frac{r^2 - 2y^2}{r^4}.$
    
    Then,
    
    $du = \frac{r^2 - 2x^2}{r^4} \ dx - \frac{2xy}{r^4} \ dy, \quad dv = -\frac{2xy}{r^4} \ dx + \frac{r^2 - 2y^2}{r^4} \ dy.$
    
    Now,
    
    $`\begin{aligned} \frac{d u^2+d v^2}{v^2} & =\frac{r^4}{y^2} \left(du^2+dv^2\right) \\ & =\frac{r^4}{y^2} \frac{1}{r^8} \left[ \left((y^2-x^2)dx - 2xy dy\right)^2 + \left(-2xy dx + (x^2-y^2)dy\right)^2 \right] \\ &=\frac{1}{r^4 y^2} \left[ \left((y^2-x^2)^2+4x^2y^2\right)dx^2 + \left(4x^2y^2+(x^2-y^2)^2\right)dy^2 \right] \\ &=\frac{1}{r^4 y^2} \left[ (x^2+y^2)^2 (dx^2 + dy^2) \right] \\ &=\frac{1}{r^4 y^2} r^4\left(dx^2+dy^2\right) = \frac{d x^2+d y^2}{y^2} \end{aligned}`$
    
    This demonstrates that the map preserves the metric.
8. Show that a compact embedded surface $\Sigma \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ must have nonnegative Gauss curvature at some point.

    **Proof**

   Since the surface is compact, the squared distance function from the origin, $f(p) = |p|^2$ attains a maximum at some point $q_0$ on the surface. At $q_0$, the tangent plane is orthogonal to the position vector from the origin to $q_0$. Analysis of the second fundamental form at this point shows that both principal curvatures are positive (or at least non-negative, but strictly positive to ensure maximality), implying $K = \kappa_1 \kappa_2 > 0$. If one principal curvature were zero or negative, it would contradict the maximality of $q_0$, as nearby points would lie outside the sphere of radius $|q_0|$.

Problems based on Thursday 1/22 lecture:

9. Show that $\left<e^k, e^{\ell}\right>_{g^*}=g^{k \ell}$.

    **Proof**

    In local coordinates, the dual metric $g^*$ on the cotangent bundle $T^*M$ is defined by

    $$\left<\alpha, \beta\right>_{g^*} = g^{ij} \alpha_i \beta_j$$

    for 1-forms $\alpha = \alpha_i e^i$ and $\beta = \beta_j e^j$. The dual basis 1-forms $e^k$ and $e^\ell$ have components $(e^k)_i = \delta^k_i$ and $(e^\ell)_j = \delta^\ell_j$. Therefore,

    $$\left<e^k, e^{\ell}\right>_{g^*} = g^{ij} (e^k)_i (e^{\ell})_j = g^{ij} \delta^k_i \delta^{\ell}_j = g^{k\ell}.$$
10. Show that $|g|_g \equiv \sqrt{n}$, where $n=\dim(M)$.

    **Proof**

    In local coordinates, for a tensor $F$ of type $(k,l)$ with components $F^{i_1 \dots i_k}_{j_1 \dots j_l}$, the squared norm is:

    $`|F|_p^2 = g_{i_1 a_1} \cdots g_{i_k a_k} g^{j_1 b_1} \cdots g^{j_l b_l} F^{i_1 \dots i_k}_{j_1 \dots j_l} F^{a_1 \dots a_k}_{b_1 \dots b_l}`$

    For the metric $g$ itself, a $(0,2)$-tensor, the squared norm is $|g|^2 = g^{ik}g^{jl}g_{ij}g_{kl}$. A clear way to compute this is to reorder the terms and contract step-by-step:

    $`|g|^2 = (g^{ik}g_{kl})g^{jl}g_{ij} = \delta^i_l g^{jl}g_{ij} = g^{ji}g_{ij} = \mathrm{tr}(g^{-1}g) = n`$

11. Show that $\mathrm{div}(u X)=u \mathrm{div} X+\langle\nabla u, X\rangle_g$.

    **Proof**

    On an oriented Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$, the divergence of a vector field $X$ is defined by

    $(\mathrm{div} X) \mathrm{vol}_g = d(\iota_X\mathrm{vol}_g)$

    For a smooth scalar function $u$ and vector field $X$, since the interior product is linear over $C^\infty(M)$,

    $`\mathrm{div}(uX) \mathrm{vol}_g = d(\iota_{uX}\mathrm{vol}_g) = d(u\iota_X\mathrm{vol}_g).`$

    Applying the Leibniz rule for the exterior derivative to the product of the 0-form $u$ and the $(n-1)$-form $\iota_X\mathrm{vol}_g$,

    $d(u\ \iota_X\mathrm{vol}_g) = du \wedge \iota_X\mathrm{vol}_g + u\ d(\iota_X\mathrm{vol}_g) = du \wedge \iota_X\mathrm{vol}_g + u (\mathrm{div} X) \mathrm{vol}_g.$

    The remaining term $du \wedge \iota_X\mathrm{vol}_g$ is an $n$-form. This equals $du(X)\mathrm{vol}_g$ by the Leibniz rule for the interior product, as $\iota_X(du \wedge \mathrm{vol}_g) = 0$ (since $du \wedge \mathrm{vol}_g$ is an $(n+1)$-form) implies $0 = (\iota_X du) \wedge \mathrm{vol}_g - du \wedge (\iota_X \mathrm{vol}_g)$, thus $du \wedge (\iota_X \mathrm{vol}_g) = (\iota_X du) \wedge \mathrm{vol}_g = du(X)\mathrm{vol}_g$, which in turn equals $\langle \nabla u, X \rangle_g \mathrm{vol}_g$.

    Substituting back yields

    $\mathrm{div}(uX) \mathrm{vol}_g = \langle \nabla u, X \rangle_g \mathrm{vol}_g + u (\mathrm{div} X) \mathrm{vol}_g.$

    Dividing by the nowhere-vanishing volume form $\mathrm{vol}_g$ gives the product rule

    $\mathrm{div}(uX) = u \mathrm{div} X + \langle \nabla u, X \rangle_g.$
12. Let $u$ and $v$ be smooth functions on an oriented manifold with boundary. Prove Green's identities:

    $\int_M u \Delta v d V_g=\int_{\partial M} u N(v) d V_{\hat{g}}-\int_M\langle\nabla u, \nabla v\rangle_g d V_g$

    and

    $\int_M(u \Delta v-v \Delta u) d V_g=\int_{\partial M}(u N(v)-v N(u)) d V_{\hat{g}} .$

    **Proof**

    By previous problem, we have

    $\mathrm{div}(u \nabla v) = u \mathrm{div}(\nabla v) + \langle \nabla u, \nabla v \rangle_g = u \Delta v + \langle \nabla u, \nabla v \rangle_g.$

    Applying the divergence theorem to $\mathrm{div}(u \nabla v)$, we have

    $\int_M \mathrm{div}(u \nabla v) dV_g = \int_{\partial M} \langle u \nabla v, N \rangle_g dV_{\hat{g}} = \int_{\partial M} u \langle \nabla v, N \rangle_g dV_{\hat{g}} = \int_{\partial M} u N(v) dV_{\hat{g}}.$

    Substituting the expression for $\mathrm{div}(u \nabla v)$ into the left-hand side gives

    $\int_M u \Delta v dV_g + \int_M \langle \nabla u, \nabla v \rangle_g dV_g = \int_{\partial M} u N(v) dV_{\hat{g}}.$

    Rearranging yields the first Green's identity:

    $\int_M u \Delta v dV_g = \int_{\partial M} u N(v) dV_{\hat{g}} - \int_M \langle \nabla u, \nabla v \rangle_g dV_g.$

    For the second identity, we apply the first identity twice, swapping $u$ and $v$ in the second application:

    $\int_M v \Delta u dV_g = \int_{\partial M} v N(u) dV_{\hat{g}} - \int_M \langle \nabla v, \nabla u \rangle_g dV_g.$

    Subtracting this from the first identity gives

    $\int_M (u \Delta v - v \Delta u) dV_g = \int_{\partial M} (u N(v) - v N(u)) dV_{\hat{g}}.$
